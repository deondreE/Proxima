1. Bulletproof Core UI Components (C++):


Before worrying about other languages, ensure your C++ core is stable and well-tested.


- Robust Rendering Pipeline:

	- Basic Shapes: Ensure drawing rectangles, circles (if planned), and lines is efficient and correct.

	- Image Handling: Loading and rendering static images.



- Fundamental Widgets:

	- Text Input: Basic keyboard input, cursor, selection, scrolling.

	- Layout Managers: StackLayout is a good start. Consider FlowLayout (like CSS flexbox) and GridLayout for more complex arrangements.


- Event System:
  - React like event control, allows the user to control when and what the event can do.
  - Translate SDL events rather then RAW X11, package SDL with this.

	- Input Handling: Keyboard (keypress, keyup), mouse (click, hover, mouse down/up, scroll).

	- Event Propagation: How events travel through the UI hierarchy (e.g., from child to parent, or deepest child first).

	- Focus Management: Which widget receives keyboard input.


- Resource Management:
	- Fonts, Textures: Proper loading, caching, and cleanup.

	- Memory Safety: Minimize raw pointers, use smart pointers where appropriate (as you're doing with std::unique_ptr in View::children).


2. Clear and Stable C-Callable API (FFI Layer):


This is the most critical step for multi-language support. C is the lingua franca for FFI (Foreign Function Interface) in most languages.


- Design a C API Header: Create a .h file that exposes your core UI functions and structures using C-style declarations (extern "C").
	- Functions for creating, destroying, setting properties (pos, size, text, color, font), and attaching callbacks for all your core UI elements.

	- Avoid C++ features like classes, templates, exceptions, or std::string in this public C API. Use raw pointers, char*, int, void* etc.


- Wrapper Functions: In your C++ implementation, write thin wrapper functions that convert C-style arguments to C++ objects and vice-versa.
	- Example: UI_Button* create_button();

	- Example: void button_set_text(UI_Button* btn, const char* text);

	- Example: void button_set_on_click(UI_Button* btn, void (*callback_fn)(void* user_data), void* user_data);


- Callbacks: Provide a mechanism for language-specific code to register callbacks for events (e.g., button click). This will require passing void* user_data so the foreign language can identify the instance that triggered the event.

3. Demonstrate with One Target Language (Python is a good start):

- Python Bindings (using ctypes or cffi):
	- Write a Python module that loads your C library (e.g., libproxima_ui.so or .dll).

	- Create Python classes that wrap your C structs/pointers (UI_Button* becomes a Python Button object).

	- Map the C functions to Python methods.

	- Crucially, implement the callback mechanism: A Python function can be passed to the C layer, which then calls it when an event occurs. This often involves creating a C function pointer from the Python callable.


- Simple Example Application: A Python script that creates a window, adds a button, and prints "Button clicked!" when pressed.

4. Build System & Packaging:

- CMake (or similar): Your build system should be able to:
	- Compile your C++ library into a shared library (.so, .dll, .dylib).

	- Generate header files for your C-callable API.

	- Potentially support building static libraries for embedding.


- Basic Packaging: Think about how others would use your library. Provide clear instructions for building and linking.

What NOT to focus on (for MVP):

- All Target Languages at Once: Focus on C++ and one other (e.g., Python) first. The FFI layer is the common denominator.

- Complex Custom Widgets: Stick to basics.

- Animation/Transitions: Can come later.

- Theming/Styling Engine: Basic colors are fine for MVP.

- Cross-platform quirks (beyond basic SDL): Get it working on one OS, then port.

By focusing on these areas, you'll establish a strong foundation. The C-callable API is the bridge, and once that's solid, extending to Rust, Lua, or others becomes a much more manageable task, as they all have robust FFI capabilities.
