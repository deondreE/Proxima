TODO: Proxima UI Core Development (MVP)

1. Bulletproof Core UI Components (C++)

- Fundamental Widgets:

  - Develop robust Text Input (keyboard, cursor, selection, scrolling).

  - Create basic Layout Managers (StackLayout, FlowLayout, GridLayout).

- Resource Management:
  - Establish robust loading, caching, and cleanup for Fonts and Textures.

2. Clear & Stable C-Callable API (FFI Layer)

- API Header (.h):

  - Define a C-style API (using extern "C") exposing core UI functions and structs.

  - Avoid C++ features (classes, templates, exceptions, std::string) in the public API.

- Wrapper Functions:

  - Write thin C++ wrappers to convert between C-style arguments and C++ objects.

- Callbacks:
  - Implement a void\* user_data mechanism for language-specific event callbacks.

3. Demonstrate with Python Bindings

- Python Bindings (ctypes/cffi):

  - Create a Python module to load the C library.

  - Develop Python classes wrapping C structs/pointers.

  - Map C functions to Python methods.

  - Implement the Python -> C callback mechanism.

- Simple Example App:
  - Build a Python script with a window, button, and click event.

4. Build System & Packaging

- CMake Setup:

  - Configure CMake to compile C++ into shared libraries.

  - Generate C-callable API header files.

  - (Optional) Support static library builds.

- Basic Packaging:
  - Provide clear build and linking instructions.

---

NOT for MVP:

- Multi-language support beyond C++ and Python.

- Complex custom widgets.

- Animation/transitions.

- Advanced theming/styling engine.

- Extensive cross-platform quirk handling (beyond basic SDL).

1. Leverage Modern C++ for Concise and Expressive Syntax

This is about making the C++ code itself easier to write, read, and maintain.

- Builder Pattern / Fluent API:

      - Instead of myButton->setText("Login"); myButton->setWidth(200);, you could write:

      Button::create("Login")
            .width(200)
            .height(50)
            .backgroundColor({0, 120, 215, 255})
            .onClick([](ButtonEvent& e){ /* handler */ });



      - How to do it: Make property setters return *this (or this->shared_from_this() for shared pointers) to allow chaining.

      - DX Benefit: Highly readable, reduces boilerplate, allows inline configuration.

- Designated Initializers / Aggregate Initialization (C++20):

      - If your UI elements have simple constructors or aggregate properties, this can reduce boilerplate.

      Proxima::UI::Rect myRect {
          .x = 10,
          .y = 10,
          .width = 100,
          .height = 50,
          .color = {255, 0, 0, 255}
      };

- DX Benefit: Clearer intent, no need for specific setter methods if properties are public.

- Variadic Templates for Children/Layout:

      - Allow adding multiple children directly in the constructor or a single call.

      StackLayout::create(
          Text::create("Hello"),
          Button::create("OK")
      ).spacing(10);



      - DX Benefit: More compact hierarchy definition.

- Lambdas for Event Handlers:

      - You already have this with your EventDispatcher, which is excellent. Directly defining callbacks inline significantly improves DX over needing separate named functions or member methods for every event.

---

2. Sophisticated Layout System

This is crucial for managing complexity without hardcoding coordinates.

- Reactive / Constraint-Based Layout:

      - Instead of just x,y,width,height, think in terms of relationships: "This button is 10px from the left edge of its parent," "This text is centered horizontally," "These two elements should always be the same height."

      - Flexbox-like System: This is perhaps the most powerful and widely adopted layout paradigm for responsive UIs. It allows elements to grow, shrink, and distribute space dynamically.

      - How to do it: This requires a layout solver engine. Libraries like Yoga (Facebook's Flexbox engine) are open-source C++ and could be integrated or serve as inspiration.

      - DX Benefit: Define relationships once, UI adapts automatically. Significantly reduces manual calculation and fragility.

- Automatic Sizing Based on Content:

      - Text elements should calculate their preferredSize based on font, text, and wrapping.

      - Image elements should use their asset's native dimensions.

      - Buttons should size based on their text and padding.

      - How to do it: Each View subclass overrides a virtual getPreferredSize() method.

      - DX Benefit: No need to guess or hardcode sizes for content-driven elements.

---

3. Styling and Theming System

Move visual attributes out of direct code when possible.

- CSS-like Properties:

      - Allowing a declarative style sheet to define colors, fonts, borders, padding, etc., for elements based on their type, id, or class attribute.

      - How to do it: Parse a custom style language (even a simplified CSS-like one) in C++ at runtime. Each View would need a applyStyle(StyleProperties props) method.

      - DX Benefit: Change app-wide themes or component styles without recompiling C++. Clean separation of visuals from structure.

- Component Styling:

      - Allow components to define their own default styles that can be overridden by a global theme.

---

4. Component-Based Architecture and Reusability

- Atomic Components: Design your Button, Text, Image as small, self-contained units.

- Composition: Build complex components by composing simpler ones (e.g., a NumericInput might compose a TextInput and Buttons for increment/decrement). This is naturally C++ OOP, but emphasizing it helps manage complexity.

- State Management: Think about how a component's internal state (e.g., bu tton pressed,slider value) affects its rendering and how it exposes changes.

---

5. Tooling to Augment Pure C++ (Not Replace It)

This is where you bridge the "visual feedback" gap without abandoning C++.

- Immediate Mode Debug Overlay:

      - Think Dear ImGui. While ImGui is a full UI library, the concept of its debug windows is relevant.

      - Create a simple debug overlay that can inspect the ProximaUI hierarchy, show bounding boxes, display layout manager calculations, and list active events at runtime.

      - How to do it: Your ProximaUI could expose internal structure for a custom debug renderer.

      - DX Benefit: See why elements are where they are, identify layout issues visually, without needing an external editor.

- Live Property Editing (Debug Mode):

      - In a debug build, allow developers to change properties (color, text, size) of a selected UI element via the debug overlay, and see the change immediately.

      - How to do it: Requires reflection (or std::map<std::string, std::function<void(View*, const std::string&)>> setters) for your component properties.

      - DX Benefit: Quick iteration on visual tweaks without recompile.

- Unit Tests for UI Components:

      - Ensure your layout calculations and component behaviors are correct and robust.

      - DX Benefit: Catch layout bugs early, increase confidence in UI logic.

---

6. Opinionated Framework Design

- Strong Conventions: Define clear patterns for component creation, property setting, layout configuration, and event handling.

- Sensible Defaults: Components should look decent and behave reasonably well with minimal configuration.

---

By implementing these features, especially a fluent API, a powerful layout system (like Flexbox), a runtime styling system, and a good debug overlay, you can make pure C++ UI development significantly more enjoyable and efficient for complex interfaces. You won't get the drag-and-drop experience of a visual designer, but you'll gain:

- Unparalleled Performance: No parsing overhead, no interpretation layer, direct C++ execution.

- Full C++ Power: Leverage templates, metaprogramming, and direct memory control.

- Strong Type Safety: All UI construction is checked at compile time.

- Deep Customization: You own the entire stack.

It's a huge undertaking, but it's how some highly optimized and performant applications manage their UIs in pure C++.
